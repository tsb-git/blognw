                                <h2>Bengal’s own Festival
remains untarnished ever
in the face of calamities
History reveals</h2>
                                <p class="excert">
                                    Puja takes place during the Aswin month of
Bengali calendar , usually either in the October or
end September in English calendar. But this time it is
something different. As per Bengali almanac the month
Aswin is denoted as an inauspicious month(malmas)
when any sort of auspicious work is prohibited. In the
dawns of Mahalayas the Bengalees are used to listen
to Mahisasuramardini- the programme welcoming
Durgapuja with the note Aswiner Sarada prate beje
uthechhe alokmanjari (Puja mornings in Aswin month
tinkle with luminosity )in the voice of Birendra Krishna
Bhadra broadcast from All India Radio station. With
Mahalaya the counting of puja days start though there is
no scriptural link to it. However, some contraventions
are found at times. In 1982 same thing happened, puja
came late by more than a month after Mahalaya. In
fact , one can get the scent of Durgapuja from the sky,
from the air of Bengal and feel that the Durga puja is
approaching. The natural surroundings get remarkably
changed. The air carrying the fragrance of Siuli flower,
the sky having the floating bunch of ethereal cloud
and the catkins in villages inform that puja is coming.
Something is wrong but this time, that atmosphere is
foiled either may be of Corona Pandemic or because
of late arrival of puja after Mahalaya. Catkins are
certainly blooming , fragfrance of siuli is around, the
natural atmosphere of autumn even in rain peeps in but
we are having mental problem to come out from last
six months’ corona spell. From that point of view the
situation is really something unprecedented.
                                </p>
                                
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-lg-12">
                                <p>
                                            History reveals that Bengal’s own festival Durgotsav
remained untarnished even in the face of various
calamities in past also but there was no compromise
with puja that was observed in a grand manner, if not
incapable at all. This time also we do hope that the
Durgotsav will be observed after following due strict
health guidelines.
Let’s turn the pages of history to review such cases
in past . In the monthly Magazine Basumati while writing a
serial under the title Puratan Panjika (the old Almanac)
Rasaraj Amritalal Basu, the famous theatre personality,
had nicely explained the Bengalee psychology that
dictated to celebrate the festival in a grand fashion on
the occasion of Durgapuja. He labeled Durgapuja as
Bengal’s ethnic festival and elaborated some aspects in
his excellent style of narration.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Durgotsab is Bengal’s ethnic festival. This is like being
immersed during the monsoon Bengalees wipe their
entire bodies in Aswin and put on new clothes to get
engaged in the work of new life. Bengalees welcome the
Mahashakti (super power) in the name of Anandamoyee
in Aswin month and place her in the hearts of their own
families. Bengalees are not satisfied just to prostrate on
the ground imagining their parents staying afar in the
void and in formless form. Rather they like to instill
life of Mother in the idol and place her in a Mandap.
Imagining the dear daughter residing at the house of
her husband coming to her Father’s house they become
emotional out of joy. The gist is that Mother Durga is not only Devi to
Bengalees but also daughter of the house. So she is
named Uma. Amritalal says, Bengalees never give any
importance to the obstacles in the face of puja. Obstacles
may come, still the home coming of the daughter is
always welcome, whatever may be the means. The most
important matter is she is coming back to her own
home. In those days the storms during Sept-Oct were
very famous in Kolkata and historical evidences are
there that the public life used to be devastated because
of the storms. Naturally that affected also Durgapuja.
This time also we faced Amphan during May. Since there
is a reasonable gap with the puja month this is under
control now. But the natural calamity during Sept -Oct
month just before puja did seldom give any chance to
control the situation. There is a big and abnormal hike
in the price of everything during the puja time when
everything in general is costly. The abnormal high price
did create trouble earlier, that tradition continues till
today. But even amidst the loss and destruction because
of the storm the festive spirit of Bengalees did never get
hampered. In fact , Bengalees did not allow the note of
sorrow to destroy the mood of festivity.
                                        </p>
										<p>The situation is not much changed now in comparison
to the situation of the society then.The high price during
puja time makes life miserable even today. Shri Amritlal
gave an account how the situation made people enjoying
the puja celebration troublesome due to natural calamity
and exactly at what ratio was the price hike.
After three years in the month of Kartick since the
storm came in the night it killed many people of Calcutta
though it was not that much severe in the month of
Aswin. On the one hand it was for puja marketing time
and on the other hand the outbreak of storm, the prices
of all the goods rose up high. You will be surprised
hearing that the cost of good quality Balam rice was
more than Rs. 3/ per maund. The full grown Ruhi fish
cost 6 annas even7 annas thus the hike in price was
such that people suffered a lot. Families with 8 to10
members having earning of Rs.40/per month while
managed earlier even to afford another 2 people staying
at their places for 2/3 days were put in trouble. Only
the hut -builders, masons, labourers, and the owners of
ships carrying cargos were benefitted. The ships costing
Rs 2/or Rs 3/ per day rose to Rs. 80-90 and not dropped
under Rs.40-60 till one year.
Still people could take the abnormal expenses as
something usual and used to arrange for celebration
of puja at their level best. Though the time is changed
today but the habit of Bengalees is, I doubt, not changed.
However, there is a basic and qualitative difference
between the association of people in Durgapuja in those
days and today. The impact of Baro Yari Puja was not
then that much as it is today.</p>
<p>In 1909 Sanatan Dharmarakshini Sava started first
Baro yari Puja in Bhawanipore at Kolkata and post 25
years this Baro Yari Puja was not in popular practice.
But today the scenario is different where the basic fear
is more chances of more people getting infected by
corona virus due to puja gathering resulting ultimately
to uncontrollable wide spread of the disease. In earlier
days there was no pomp and grandeur in Baro Yari Puja
so there was no fear of spreading any contagious disease
centering puja. There was restriction in entry for public
at the pujas of aristocratic houses. So there was no link
between puja and epidemic. At least this is certain that
then the administration did least bother. The scenario
of villages used to be something different. Pujas in the
houses became the meeting place to enjoy the festivity.
As a result, when in 1918 Spanish Flu after Mumbai did
affect Kolkata people that lasted till 1920 ,the puja in
October month at Kolkata continued without a break
inspite of the sudden violent outbreak of the flu in the
month of October1919. The Baro Yari pujas of Kolkata
were not concomitant to it. No doubt, there was some
effect on in house pujas but no historical record of
discontinuation of puja is found. We have idea about plague at local levels. We have the history of death of
countless people that almost depopulated Boral village
in south 24 parganas in 1867 due to malaria. Rajnarayan
Basu depicted the picture in his ‘Gramya Upakhyan’ ,
but he wrote nothing on its effect on Durgapuja . During
that time the well off people of Boral village shifted to
some other places. We can assume that Durgapujas
of those families were discontinued, but no historical
evidence is available to that effect. There are instances
of bleakness in the villages due to cholera , that affected
puja also, still people somehow could ultimately manage
to overcome those fleeting disasters. Shri Tulsidas Basu
of the Basu family , first inhabitant of Boral village came
again to live with his family and the puja that started,
has been continuing thenceforth till today. We are not
getting any data, any record, any evidence, any instance
even orally that Durgapuja was totally stopped at any
place only because of plague or epidemic. It might have
so happened that pujas were stopped in a particular
area for a certain time in some villages or Muffasils.
Though,in Calcutta the fact was something different
in times of Spanish Flu. Calcutta Durga Pujas , controlled
by the aristocratic houses of wealthy people used to
showcase the standard of their prosperity at that time.
Recently Rwiju Basu has written an article in Ananda
Bazar Patrika describing the new norms will be followed
like use of mask and sanitization by the organizers of
200years age old Durga pujas. People were not so
much health conscious 100 years before. The rules by
doctors were also not so strict. During the spread of
Spanish Flu and even before that there was no Baro
Yari Puja as such, hence the question of infecting others
during puja did not arise. But now, the aristocratic
houses, organising Durga Pujas are planning to control
the entries of the outsiders .They did take same step in
similar situation 100 years before, revealed the family
members of some houses though no written document
is available exactly what steps were taken.</p>
<p>According to Amritalal Basu ,Bengalees are keen to
make preparation for Durgapuja , come what may and
the history of our Baro Yari Puja confirms this fact. The
pujas in Bengalee houses might have been stopped due
to financial crisis or some other reason but there is no
evidence of discontinuation of puja as a whole due to
plague or natural calamity . The example of Baro yari
puja is drawn here as because the participation of public
is much more in such pujas due to comprehensible
reason . In the Corona atmosphere the relevance of this
context is beyond question. There are evidences that
during second world war public participated in pujas
ignoring extreme obstructions and not only that , at that time seven new pujas were started in Calcutta
which earned good reputation with the time .
Firstly ,Badamtala Ashar Sangha-this puja was started
in 1939 by the local people. For last four decades the
organizers of this puja have been engaged to present
creative speciality in terms of the idol and the theme
pandal.
Secondly, the Ahiritola Sarbojonin Durgotsav, one of
the oldest Baro yari pujas near the shore of Ganges in
north Calcutta. This puja was also initiated by the local
people.
Thirdly, Mata Amba (another form of Devi Durga)
used to be worshipped in every Navaratri at Chaltabagan,
Lohapatty in North Calcutta which was transformed to
Durga puja in 1942 onwards and became famous.
Fourthly ,puja of Ekdalia Evergreen was started in
1943 by the people of Gariahat at south Calcutta and
has been still maintaining the traditional form amidst
the theme pujas by the committee members.
Fifth is the Singhee Park Puja and sixth is the
Sarbojanin Puja at Sovabajar Beniatola that was
started in1944. Halsibagan puja was started in 1945
and continues till today as an innovative well themed
puja.</p>
<p> We have to keep in mind that the people of Bengal
time and again fell in dire financial crisis and thereby
suffered a lot. In 1943 there was famine and people of
Bengal were compelled to spend the days by starving.
Moreover, the Calcuttans had another problem. People
had to leave the city in fear of the bombing from Japan.
Not only the problem of fooding but people were
stricken with the problem of clothing as well. Human
being has basic three needs –food, shelter and clothing,
even when these were at stake then also Bengalees never
hesitated to take preparation for Durgapuja. Professor
Barada Datta Roy, in his article Pujaye Banglar Bastra
Samasya published in Desh patrika in 1942 portrayed
clearly the clothing problem in Bengal during world war
and more clearly and nicely etched the sentiments and
emotions of Bengalees centering Puja even in the critical
times.
To all the Bengalees high or low Durgapuja is the
most joyful event in general to which Bengalees call
‘pujo’. During this puja wherever and in whatsoever
manner Bengalees are staying usually try to connect all
their relatives and try to show their heart felt feelings
of respect, feelings of love , feelings of affection by
offering at least some new clothing, if not something
else. This is the usual custom of Bengal, the Bengalee
Hindus. Since when this custom of greeting each other
had been started in practice and followed by the people
of Bangladesh in the remote past, nobody knows. But
that what was the sample of joy once has become
today a custom to exception of which is not possible
in Bharat-Bangladesh though it may be possible in
some other country. Those who are acquainted with
the social life of Bharat specially of Bengal, they know
that the foundation of the social ties of Bengal is linked
to this custom. Bengalees can borrow, can pledge the
ornaments, can even sell out his ancestor’s residential
house but never ever ready to change casually the
custom laid down by the ancestors.With the good
number of wars , the abnormal price of clothes, and the
disastrous days when there was no incoming fund the
main problem for Bengalees was how could he please,
bring smile in the face of his relatives, dependents , the
fostered as well as the affectionate little ones ?
We all know that post second world war, independence
of Bharat and the blow of the division of the country
distorted the foundation of Bengalee families, specially
of East Bengal . As a whole this is the one tragic history
of Bengalee. At some places in East Bengal people were
deprived of this festivity fervor for ever. But if we analyse
the entire history we can accept this as an exception.
Anyway, the people of East Bengal then suffered pain
for leaving their native land on the one hand and on
the other hand their inability to perform puja any longer
in the land of their past fourteen generations. People
in Calcutta were celebrating Durgapuja in a grand
way whereas the ever bubbling, sparkling courtyards
in East Bengal stood dark, unlighted. This inexorable
significant picture was portrayed in words on 19th Oct,
1950 in the Editorial column of Yugantar, where the
duality of Bengal was aptly sketched.
Calcutta, the great city is full of joy because of
Durgotsav ,the grandest festival of Bengal’s communal
life .Thousands and thousands of male and female, boysgirls,
have gathered and are swarming on the streets,
in the narrow lanes and bye lanes. Each and every day
of the whole of the year is wrapped with the need, the
pain. Children of Bengal get the sense of relief at least
for these 3 -4 days being free from that monotonous
sorrowful torture .Seeing the bright faces of family the
guardians feel satisfied. New tides come in businesses,
work centers even in literature and newspaper circles
due to Durgapuja. In a word, almost all people in
Bengal save few unfortunates, wait for these puja days.
So looking at the resounding celebration, illumination
with lights and the brightness of the capital city like the
conjugal night of the bride and groom we extend our
good wishes and greetings to the people ,delirious with
joy. We hope that our social life will be healthy , bright
and beautiful one day as it is now.</p>
<p>Where is that glitter of gold in the lives of East
Bengal taday? Where is the newly bloomed hope and
| 22
|
dream in the Saradiya festival? Where is that resonance
in the strings of Golden harp? Today that lotus –forest
is afflicted by communal disturbances. The altar of
worship is abandoned. The villages are as quiet as
cremation ground. Only the howling of jackals and
barking of dogs can be heard in the night times but
during day times the cackling of children, the sounds of
the bangles of quiet village maids are lost in the shriek.
The terror stricken women are fleeing , the youths are
asylum seeker, and the old people are almost dead. That
huge Hindu society of East Bengal now in tents, in
fields as unidentified, friendless, kinless can be found
at Bihar, Odissa, Madras, Mysore or in Andaman. No
one is left to light up the lamp in the land of their past
fourteen generations. No mother is awaiting her son,
no wife is awaiting her husband no one is awake till
the night in those dreamless villages. There is no one
left who can worship. Bramhins, Priests, blacksmiths,
potters, all have fled. The large society is now landless,
seeker of asylum. The penniless and robbed of middle
class are but heaving deep, weary sighs in puja days
thinking of their predecessors. We know that tears
rolling in the eyes of numerous family members- Durga
, symbol of power will not be invoked. No chanting
of slokas for fame, life, prosperity, success will be
there in the Mandaps. Devi Durga, herself is seeking
shelter today. Being landless, so many families of East
Bengal have stopped celebrating puja today. They are
roaming around like the lost case with the ration card.
Their present with the glorious past is enveloped with
tremendous sorrow, while the future is under the veil of
darkness.
Until and unless ousted as in the above portrayal,
history reveals that Bengalees never failed to organize
their own Durgotsav, an ethnic festival, in spite of
hundreds of obstacles.
This time presumably Corona situation will not be
an exception.
However, please abide by the health rules as laid
down by the Government. Be healthy, be elated.</p>
