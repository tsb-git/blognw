Festive Rhythms of
Durga Puja</h2>
                                <p class="excert">
                                    Durga Puja in West Bengal has been a center of
attraction involving year long preparation,
months of hard work for creating the beautiful
pandals and the idols. The five days celebration coupled
with the indomitable energy, pulsating to the rhythm
of Dhaaks, sleepless nights, orgy of street food comes
to a grand ceremonial end with the immersion of the
cherished idol in the water bodies. We are back into the
reality of routine life with the setting minds ready for
the next year’s festivity again!!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This year the scenario is different. The arrival of Devi
Durga is approaching near ,only few days are left!!! But
the run-up for her arrival is plunged in gloom. Even
after the Khuti Puja which is a customary ritual before
the bamboo scaffolding for Puja is under the veil of
uncertainty due to pandemic named COVID continuing
to loom over.

									<p>
                                    Durga Puja, the biggest festival in Bengal is not only
a religious festival of worshipping 10 armed goddess
representing divine power over all the evils but also a
time for generosity, hospitality, dissolving differences,
family gatherings, broaching the age old religious
tradition and pride of vintage families. Yes, it works for
strengthening religious harmony as there is no bar of
entry for people having different religious belief.
Durga Puja is celebrated twice a year in West Bengal
and many other states of India as also other parts of
the world. According to Hindu religious scriptures,
the conventional worship of Devi Durga falls in the
Bengali month of Chaitra and is called Basanti(Durga)
Puja. However, the autumnal ritual, known as Akaal
Bodhan, is more popular and widely celebrated around
different continents of the world in the Bengali month
of Ashwin as per Hindu almanac (Panjika).It is believed
that Goddess Durga, the slayer of Mahisasura, was first
worshipped in autumn by Lord Rama before going for
war against Ravana. Lord Rama invoked the blessings of
Goddess Durga by performing Chandi Homa, offering
108 blue lotuses and lighting 108 lamps. It was on the
Ashwin Shukla Dashami when Lord Rama was blessed
by the Goddess and attained triumph by killing Ravana.
There is also a belief that Durga Puja is observed as
the welcoming celebration of Goddess Durga who visits
her mother's home in this earth and goes back to her
husband Lord Shiva after 10 days.

                                    History records that grand celebration of Durga Puja
began in late 1500. There are many folk tales about
the first Durga Puja in Bengal. Raja Kangsha Narayan
of Tahirpur organized the first autumn Durga Puja in
Bengal. Tahirpur is now a municipal town of Bagmara
                                </p>

<h5>Durga Mandap, Taherpur, Bangladesh</h5>	
<h1>Sovabazar Rajbari</h1>

<p>There is another view that the first grand Puja was
organized by Raja Nabakrishna Deb of Calcutta in
honour of Lord Clive in 1757. Although this time the
COVID’s restriction seems to trim the grand celebration
of 231 years of Durga Puja of Kolkata’s Shobhabazar
                                            
                                        </p><img class="img-fluid" src="img/n4.jpg" alt="">	
<h5>Takur dalan, ChotoTaraf, Sovabazar Rajbari</h5>	<p>ChotoTaraf, started by Raj Krishna Deb, son of Raja
Naba Krishna Deb roughly around 1790.
Shri Debashish Deb, a descendant of the family revealed
through correspondence that this time the ‘ChotoTaraf’
Durga puja will strictly abide by the mandates of Social
Distancing due to uproar of pandemic. Thus the worship
of Goddess Durga who is considered as a Daughter,
visiting family once a year will be meeting only family
members with security cards, wearing masks, sanitized
hands and subjects to thermal screening. Deb, further
added that the age old traditions of freeing Neelkantha
Birds, as a messenger, sharing news of the arrival of Devi
Durga to Lord Shiva and preparations of 52 various dry
forms of food and offerings will not be observed due
to various circumstantial and other situation. This time
the dread of pandemic has dampened the enthusiasm
for preparations. The phenomena of social distancing
has been the focal point right from the Kathamo
Puja during UltaRath, and will remain significantly
all the same throughout the festive time. Since they
are compelled to cut short the usual pomp and show
during immersion, where Goddess is usually being
carried by 26 people, this time the size and the width
of the idol which is usually 13fts in heights and 9fts in
breadth are reduced to enable the use of trolley with
not more than 8 carriers. A strict measure will be taken
to ensure that the materials brought from outside for
the puja are well sanitized especially flowers which will
be provided by the family during Pushpanjali(offering
prayers and flowers)to be conducted in multiple batches
with less people. Unlike many others, Goddess in this
household is being offered dry rice, sugar, sweets and
snacks which will also be limited as the team of people
who are involved in preparing these items, following the
age old traditions are brought from Midnapur District
of Bengal and due to irregular transport services and
travel restrictions, the family is doubtful about their
participation this time.

                                            Even though we are surrounded with restrictions and
apprehensions our prayers resonate for the blessings of
Goddess so that the –“Pandemic and fear of Pandemic
should wash off, social distancing should dissolve.
People should congregate with a feel of oneness soon
again”- Sri Debashish Deb, Member of “Shobhabazar
RajBari, ChotoTaraf”opines.
                                        </p>
										<h1>The legacy of Saborno Roy Choudhury's</h1>
     									<p>The history of Kolkata or the colonial Calcutta will
remain incomplete without mentioning the legacy of Saborno Roy Choudhurys. The family had link with
almost all major historical events of Kolkata. Right
from the construction of the first road, first pucca
house, leasing of Kalikata’s Sutanuti and Gobindopur
to the British, construction of Kalighat Temple complex
to the point as to legate one of the oldest Durga Pujas
in the town, in the year 1610, the trend of worshipping
Mother Durga and her four children together in one
Chalchittra(one single frame) the role of this family was
pivotal. A conversation with Sri.Probal Roychoudhury,
the scion of this renowned family, now responsible for
upholding the tradition and customs of 411 years in
purest form said,’Durga Puja is not only unique but it is
a fusion of history, heritage and tradition that has been
touched upon by the family for centuries. The rituals are
followed as per the notations of Durga Bhakti Tarangini
by Bidyapati. However, with the time the grandeur of
the Puja is faded, the rippling of chandeliers drawing
light and energy are tarnished, changes like no animal
sacrifice has been welcomed. Despite challenges due to
pandemic this time, in 1918 & 1919 during the outbreak
of Spanish Flu even, the tradition of Durga Puja was
not withheld. Goddess was and will be worshipped with
utmost belief, faith and adulations. Thus the pandemic
called COVID-19 will nowhere be able to hinder the
indomitable spirit of this age old tradition of the family.</p>
</p><img class="img-fluid" src="img/n5.jpg" alt="">	
<h5>Durgotsav of Barisha Baro Bari
(Saborno Roy Choudhurys Paribar), 1925</h5>
										<p>The preparations have already been started, from
Janmasthami itself with Kathamopuja, with buffing dust
and burnishing doors and corridors. Shri Roychoudhury
discerns that the rituals will be solemnized with utmost
precaution and sanitization. The importance will be
given to distancing measures, and the offerings to the
Goddess will be homemade including the flowers. The
in house garden- plucked flowers will be used for puja
this time. He added that the impact of the COVID-19 is
visible especially with regards to the height and size of
the idol as less artisans are involved due to the risk of
susceptibility.</p>
										<p>“Though the Puja will be of small scale without
any claim or proclaim the prayers for Goddess will
be to take care of all her children and eradicatie the
pandemic at the earliest.”- Shri Probal Roy Chowdhury,
descendant of Saborno Roy Chowdhury comments. His
voice echoed beyond the tales of casted iron balustrades
of double stair cases, ornate ceilings, European Style
Verandahs, semi-circular balconys and quadrangle
courtyard with Thakur Dalan.
This Dalan is standing till date as a live witness
of lavish Durga Pujas, memorable social gatherings
epitomizing the opulence of past Calcutta through
the palatial mansions of these conventional families.
Though with time the ruined tor of these mansions has
been a subject of various socio-economic transitions,
this time it is shackled a bit more with the clauses of
COVID.</p>

<h1>Guptipara “Baro-Yaari” puja</h1>
										<p>An away day nurturing makes me managing my
eyes to the narratives of Durga Puja in West Bengal,
the chronicles of first community Puja in the form of
Jagadhatri Puja (another form of Devi Durga) was
worshipped as “Bindyabashini”in 1758, 262 years back.
The most popular myth compounding the community
Puja credits the consortium of 12 friends of Guptipara
in Hoogly district of West Bengal, who collected
contributions from the local residents to conduct the
first community or “Baro-Yaari Puja” indexing as
“Twelve-Pal Puja”. It was this “Baro-Yaari” puja that
later set the trend of Sarbajanin Puja or Community
Puja since 1910. The first of its kind was performed by
Sanatan Dharmotsahini Sabha at Balaram Bose Ghat
Street, Bhowanipore, Kolkata, and down the line has
become the dominant form. With the innovative ideas
and extravaganza the community Durga Pujas have
been able to draw global attention elaborating the spirit
of oneness. Such community gatherings not only tie one with another over faith and ritualistic practices but also
transpire the message of love and humanity, aspiring to
rise above the narrow division of caste, class, religion
and ideology.</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="img/n6.jpg" alt="">	
<h5>Baro-Yaari puja mandap, Guptipara</h5>
<br>
<h1>Kumartuli</h1>
										<p>Durga Puja is celebrated in lot of cities, countries
and continents, but what makes it unique in Kolkata
is the artistic presentation that transforms the city to
an Art Expo. The uniqueness in every theme and the
spirit of creativity out of freedom of artistic expression
along with the revival of traditions, forgotten myths
and mythologies, array of inherited forms of craftwork,
diversifications and contemporary outlooks applied to
portray the Goddess make altogether spectacular. The
thematic idea also focuses on concurrent issues like
environment, climate change, women empowerment
and world affairs transmuting pandals to a sentient
agent ferrying messages, concerns and awareness
amongst the onlookers. Thus community Durga Puja
gets etched in public mind because of grand looks,
crowd pulling caliber and accolades as also harps
on attaining economic augmentation amongst rural
artisans, who use their traditional skills and creativity
in designing and building temporary pavilion as a house
of Deity. For artisans Durga Puja is more than just a
creative outlet, it is an opportunity to improve lives and
social status, typically for a pair of hands working in
shifts everyday for four to five months prior to festivals.
Their unique and unrivaled charisma of art, imagination
and professional strokes on idol and decorations on
marquees enable the Durga Puja Committees to bid
awards, attract sponsorships and most importantly
fascinate the spectators worldwide.</p>
										<p>The question that continues to dawdle- Will the
aggressive cloud of pandemic envelope the livelihood
of craftsman and artisans, depending widely on such exuberance of festive season to fulfill their year
round rudimentary exigencies? Will they succumb to
COVID-19?
A fleeting visit to Kumartuli, a hub of idol makers
which should have been alive and in full swing as Durga
Puja is just a knock away, revealed a bleak emptiness
this year as sweltering of Corona and thrashes of
Amphan had suffocated survivability of this potters’
colony in the northern part of the city. A conversation
with a lady idol maker Mrs. Meenakshi Pal who
challenged patriarchy and now schlepping the hundred
year old family profession stated that the potters colony
is reeling under the mounting loss due to cancellation</p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="img/n7.jpg" alt="">	
<h5>Kankana Roy</h5>
										<p>calls of idol booking that triggered for lock down
during peak booking months this year. Pal added that
from Basanti and Annapurna Puja heralding the festive
season marked a stygian situation for numerous hands
engaged in shaping idols and thereby earning breads. The situation remained grim without much improvement
even after number of phases of unlock. Even Durga Puja
Committees are delved with uncertainties. Therefore we
have hardly received orders, and what we have, there
are persistent demands to reduce the shape and size, not
exceeding more than 8fts in height and 5fts in width so
that the installation and immersion of such idols will
involve less people to keep the social distancing norms
tight in place. Moreover, there are hardly any orders
coming from UK,US and Australia as they remain worst
hit nations. The dearth of orders from foreign countries
have created financial dent. Further, the demand of
sanitization and special protection wraps increase
the charges on shipment to other states and countries
excessively. The Covid containment measures of lock
and unlock have resulted challenges in procurement of
materials, along with perpetual paucity of studio space,
and measures of self-distancing have tethered creativity
and efficiency of craftsman remarkably.</p>
										<p>“Cancellation of orders, slush in price of idols due to
reduced shapes and sizes, shortfalls of human resources
have put the existence and sustainability of hundreds
of artisans at Kumartuli into question mark. Measures
like serving food and visits followed with disenchanted
promises cannot sink the dystrophies meted due to
pandemic and natural calamity this year- The monetary
measures should be piped in to preserve the artery of
this living history hereafter”. -Meenakshi Pal, Idol
Maker Kumartuli comments.</p>

<h1>Kolkata Pujas</h1>
										<p>The hazards of COVID-19 hardly foists any silver
lining on the Community Durgotsav. The discussion
with renowned theme maker,whose creative endeavors
have made Pujas of Lake Town, Ahiritola, Hatibagan
and Lalabagan very appealing,revealed the fact .
Prashanta Pal said that this year creating a theme
puja is a huge challenge due to 70 to 80% reduction in
the budget, lack of sponsorship and stringent pandemic
guidelines. He elucidated that instead of extravaganza,
Puja committees are now inclined to solemnize the
puja with basic rituals and practices. Certain measures
have been adopted –firstly the pandal décor is made
simple so that it drags less people and less artisans
are involved- almost half as compared to the previous
years. Mandatory COVID tests were conducted before
involving artisans, facilities are provided so that they
are less exposed to the outer world as long as they are
occupied with the construction of pandals. We have
made sanitizers and masks a must for them. “As theme
makers we do understand the economic strain of the artisans, hence the ones who are not involved this time
will be engaged during Jagadhatri Puja which is in the
pipeline, hitting in the next month. In order to void
community transmission, we are stressing on Digital
Darshans or Darshans on Wheels this year”</p>
										<p>Anirban Das- His unique frame of art featuring
contemporary realities has always been a crowd puller
of some famous pujas in the city, The Chetla Agrani,
Dum Dum Park and Behala Friends colony did feature
his artful presentation. He recalled that previous year
during this time the work was in full swing, whereas
this time we are uncertain whether and how the Puja
will be conducted. Apart from sticking to strict COVID
guidelines and cost effective attributes in theme pujas,
emphasis is given to ensure the health and safety of
artisans involved. The Puja themes in every sense will
represent the adversities of Corona. At the same time it
will also transmute a ray of hope that the country after
a long dark night is responding to the calls of normalcy
by following the unlock norms in their everyday routine.
Various forms and shades of environmental crafts will
be used and their placements too will ensure social
distancing norms!</p>
										<p>Tala Baroari Puja celebrating centenary year is
also plunged with uncertainties. Committee members
nodded, Yes, there will be Puja but not on grand scale.
The guidelines will be observed definitely. The challenge
is to ensure that the COVID-19 mandates issued by
Government of West Bengal are fulfilled without any
chaos!</p>

										<p>Nepal Bhattacharya Steet Durga Puja: Abhijit Bose,
a member of the Committee mentioned that there
will be Durga Puja but with limited resources and
precautions. Initiatives like giant screen, sufficient
place for the movement of cars and bikes are designed
so that commuters without stopping can see the Deity.
Durga puja for us is an occasion to stand beside socially
ostracized and economically challenged people. We
ensure that they become a part of our celebration every
year. This year also we will invite members and students
from Blind schools to inaugurate the puja. We will
extend support to members of Red Light area, slums
and also residents of old age home by providing food
and essentials.</p>
										<p>“We have considered this year Durga Puja as a
Challenge and we are ready to accept it. We will try our
best to observe all the rituals and practices and make
the promises fulfilled, without endangering or affecting
anyone”- Abhijit Bose of Nepal Bhattacharya Street
Durga Puja asserts.
Shiv Mandir Durga Puja : Partha Ghosh believes that
though Durga Puja is going to be very different this
year, it should definitely be done as it will enable people
to scrap the fear in their minds about the pandemic. The
fear and panic surrounding COVID is hampering the
mental peace. Though remaining affixed to sanitization
measures will continue for long we should try at least
mentally to come back to normalcy. Shib Mandir Puja
committee like others is taking appropriate measuresartisans
involved have undergone Covid test, and likely
to undergo a second round before leaving for homes so
that they can carry the negative certificate with them and do not face any trouble and discrimination on
return to their villages. However, if anybody is tested
positive then Puja Committee will take the responsibility
for his treatment. This year the theme and puja itself
will not be something grand but through pandal décor,
advertisements more stress will be given on spreading
awareness of pandemic, precautions censuring myths
and prejudices compounding pandemic.</p>
										<p>“Durga Puja and its celebration has become an
identity of West Bengal , despite multiple challenges we
will not leave any stone unturned to preserve this global
identity-once identity is cleaved it will be difficult to
treasure it later on”- Partha Ghosh, Shiv MandirDurga
Puja Committee confirms.</p>

<!-- <h5>Tala Baroari</h5> -->
<h1>Puja in North Bengal</h1>
										<p>A telephonic conversation with Sri Subhashish
Sengupta, Secretary –Nipendra Narayan Hall’s 106
years old Durga Puja at Sree Mandir, Darjeeling
divulged his concern about the Puja. The wave of health
calamity has also exerted brakes on the enthusiasm of
celebrations in this region. He said that the puja cannot
be stopped but without sponsorship and support it will
be difficult for them this time. Durga Puja in regions of
Darjeeling is a manifestation of community solidarity as Bengalees, Nepalees, Tibetans Marwaris and many other
community members assemble for prayers. The Idol
for the puja is usually purchased from Kumartuli, and
brought by the committee members personally but this
year we are preferring shipments with strict sanitization
measures. This year the utmost importance is given on
sanitization, and Bhog will be served accordingly.</p>
										<p>Sengupta’s voice reiterates the words of other
organisers- ‘We only wish that the period of crisis soon
be dissolved, only prayers can save the world and help
Darjeeling to return to its tunes filled with warmth,
togetherness and enlightenment’.
Ramkrishna Mission Vedanta Math , Pralay Maharjji,
the Secretary has firm conviction that only prayers and
faith in God may enable the world to sail through this
crisis. The puja of the Math was started in 1939 by
Swami Avedananda Maharaj out of faith in the feeling
of oneness beyond parity over class, caste, religion and
other factors. The condition is extremely deplorable this
time in terms of economy and participation. Darjeeling
,to a large extent depends on tourism and now remains
one of the worst victims of pandemic. The organization
this time is equally focusing on relief activities, so that
no child is abandoned without food and medicine .
However, as in past we have faith that this time also we
will be able to wade through adversities.</p>
										<p>“He is the creator, He will be the resolver too”-
Pralay Maharj,SecretaryRamkrishna Mission Vedanta
Math,Darjeeling ,expresses his faith on God. The blow of COVID -19 has also tendered huge
brainstorming among the overseas organizers. Nirmal
Chatterjee, the General Secretary of Ujaban Parishad
insinuates that the festival binds communities, religion
of riparian Indo-Bangladesh through the string of
harmony, faith and happiness but this will not be the
same as previous years. Durga Puja in Bangladesh is
celebrated unanimously from grassroots to moneyed
without any discrimination in its practices, customs
and religious rationales. Around 32,000 Pujas are
being celebrated every year across the country. This
time the country will witness with meagerness in terms
of its celebrations, lightning, cultural events. Even
the immersion will be inconspicuous as the country
has to abide by the norms and principles of COVID
guidelines issued by the ministry. A lot of ictus is given on online Darshan facilities. Prasad will be distributed
among small groups. Various Puja committees jointly
and in their own respective ways are offering support
to regions of Koira and its annexed parts, affected
by Amphan. We are trying also to facilitate support
towards the sustainability of artisans and craftsmen
who are associated with Puja to support their families.
The country’s insipidity over Puja is affecting overall
multiple co-related factors specially economy &
marketing, trade & travel and likes.
Therefore the country now remains concerned to
focus only on stellar of hope to shine soon over disarray
and belligerence caused due to the virus.
Scenario at Myanmar seems nowhere different –
sources revealed that the upsurge in fresh COVID-cases
and sporadic lockdowns in the country has made the
celebration very doubtful. On whole including Navratri
and others around 16 such Durga Puja’s are been held
at Yangon. Though the 132 yr old Durga Puja that is
celebrated at Durgabari, Yangon remains prominent</p>
