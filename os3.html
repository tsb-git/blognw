                                <h2>Andaman and Nicobar Islands
A Fresh Approach</h2>
                                <p class="excert">
                                    The inauguration of the Chennai-Port Blair undersea cable by
the Prime Minister a month ago was a dream come true for the
islanders, who felt deprived and ignored by their fellow countrymen.
Having had the good fortune of working in the Andamans & Nicobar
Islands for around 5 years scatterdly, spread over three decades, it
is clear that there is fresh thinking in New Delhi on the tremendous
benefits that these Islands can provide to the nation. The completion
of the much-awaited undersea cable and PM’s mention of the
potential for a transhipment port at Great Nicobar are indications of
this changed mind-set. In June 1984, on her last visit to the Islands,
Smt Indira Gandhi was specifically asked at a press conference at
the Port Blair airport about the potential of declaring Great Nicobar
Island as a Free Port. The background was that it was becoming
clear that the British would sooner or later hand-over Hong Kong to
the Chinese. The Hong Kong Indian community, who had thrived in
business, seriously considered locating to India but realised that the
then prevailing socialist thinking did not think highly of legitimate
ways of achieving economic success. The only way out of the thicket
of the strangulation of economic policies would be the creation of a
Free Port, or what is now popularly known as FTZ. Great Nicobar’s
location at the mouth of the Malacca Strait suggested the way out
but Smt Gandhi dismissed that. If I recall, she said that Hong Kong
succeeded because it had a massive hinterland (China), while Great
Nicobar was far away from mainland India. The thought that foreign
trade, or re-exports could be niche was lost on her. Therefore, at
present, for success India needs to build on these ideas of India as a
hub. But the way ahead is not an easy one since it involves a change
of mind-set.

									<p>
                                    There are a few building blocks that must be understood. They
point to certain limitations in terms of standard growth strategies,
but also suggest alternatives and innovations. Once these are
internalised, the potential of these islands seems almost limitless.
First, we have to understand that India’s eastern coastline does not
run from Kanyakumari to Kolkata via Chennai and Vishakhapatnam.
It runs from East Island, off North Andamans to the southern tip of
Great Nicobar. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are not an adjunct
to India, but a part of it. Our understanding must be up-graded; the
defence of the motherland starts there. These days it has become
fashionable to speak of the Islands as India’s unsinkable aircraft
carrier. However, it must be remembered that aircraft carriers do
not operate in isolation but are accompanied by task forces, to both
protect them and to enable them to operate at full potential. Similarly,
the islands need to be strengthened militarily and economically. From
being just a defensive fortress, the islands could be used to project
India’s power into the South China Sea, e.g. allow quick humanitarian
response to disasters, escort Indian shipping if threatened etc. An
economically vibrant economy would help to provide resources and
supplies necessary for using the islands to project India’s power into
the Malacca Straits and beyond.
Second, we must creatively use the islands to make them
economically vibrant, recognising that over 90% of the islands are
forests, and a substantial portion is tribal reserves. The trouble is
that by preservation particularly of the tribal population, we think of
them as zoos, and not as living beings with agency. The Nicobars
are almost completely tribal. Unfortunately, post-Tsunami, we have made the Nicobari community dependant on the State for almost
everything. This has affected their mental and physical health with
increased rate of hypertension, high blood pressure, depression
and alcoholism. They are otherwise an outgoing people who have
produced excellent footballers, cyclists and canoeists who have
represented India internationally. Their leaders and youth agree that
their Islands can be opened up, to groups of tourists, to begin with.
The Nicobar Islands, particularly Car Nicobar, Katchal and Kamorta
have not just excellent beaches but some locations are ideal for
water sports (Nancowry Harbour) and Golf courses (Kamorta and
Katchal). Great Nicobar is the only place in India where surf-riding
is possible, and this particular activity can be done without entering
a tribal reserve. These are just examples. However, unimaginative
application of outdated laws has stifled the development of most
tourist facilities even in the non-tribal areas of Andamans. That the
tribals have not benefitted from such ‘preservation’ does not seem to
be a consideration to many analysts and policy-makers. We should
look for ways by which they can express themselves and see their
potential grow.Third, the importance of the submarine cable cannot be overemphasized.
I remember when I was last posted there (2009-12),
the Nicobar district had difficulties accessing MNREGA funds as all
reports had to be uploaded electronically. The cell-phone coverage
was barely adequate in Port Blair, and non-existent in the Nicobars,
since the islands were on the edge of India’s satellite footprints. We
used to bring data by pen-drives from Car Nicobar to Port Blair and
then upload on the website of Ministry of Rural Development. We did
plan the submarine cable project then but a lack of in-house capacity
both in Port Blair and in government of India delayed the project by
almost ten years. The government needs to be congratulated for
connecting the islands to the Indian mainland. It can potentially
trigger the development of IT-enabled service industry in the Islands.
The non-polluted air, blue skies and excellent beaches combined with
much improved connectivity can be used to attract IT companies to
set up shop in the islands. Electricity and water supply would have to
be stepped us, and some steps like the foundation stone of the 50
MW floating Gas turbine power plant at Hopetown are steps in the
right direction. Water supply is still an issue, though, and the sooner
the South Bay could be converted into a fresh water lake, as is done
in the Netherlands, the better it would be. Port Blair would need 1-2
excellent schools and an environmentally sensitive Building Code
plan to ensure a high quality of life that is affordable. The excessive
use of steel and concrete is an environmental and aesthetic disaster.
Fourth is the need to expedite the transhipment port process,
whose complete blueprint was prepared by a team working with me
in 2011 and sent to Home Ministry for approval. I had personally
explained the project to the then Home Minister, Shri P Chidambaram.
Great Nicobar sits at the mouth of the Malacca Straits, making it
economically and strategically very important. It is a perfect location
for any shipping-related activities. However, we found that the site
initially chosen, South Bay at the mouth of the Galathea River, had
become unfit post-Tsunami, for any port-related work. The land
abutting had sunk, and would require millions of cubic feet of earth to
be imported to try and make it just about functional, besides diverting
large forest area. Water depths for a considerable distance into the
sea was also inadequate for large ships to come alongside. We came
to the conclusion that Campbell Bay, barely 30 kms away, presented
a more viable option. Reasonable depths that would enable big ships
to operate were available fairly close to the existing breakwater, and
adequate land was available that could be diverted for port use. An
added benefit was the presence of a small airport, whose runway
could be extended to take larger aircrafts. If this port is developed,
India’s dependence on Colombo, Port Klang and Singapore would
be reduced considerably. In fact, a private Hyderabad-based shipper
used to use Port Blair harbour as transhipment port for the import of
lentils (dal) from Myanmar, but the company went out of business,
for different unconnected reasons.
Fifth, would be the need to improve the airport at Diglipur in
North Andamans and provide for proper facilities for civilian traffic
at the Air Force Station Car Nicobar, besides the lengthening runway
at Campbell Bay. Inter-island travel by ship or helicopter is very
expensive and slow. A twin-engine sea plane would not only help
link nearby tourist spots to Port Blair, but once connected to Diglipur,
Mayabunder, Little Andaman, Car Nicobar, Nancowry-Kamorta
and Campbell Bay, would be a game changer. Some of this was
tried almost ten years ago and was very popular. The government
has taken up the construction of two bridges at Middle Strait and
Baratang, the completion of which would serve a long-pending
demand of the local people. In all these activities, the local society,
economy and tourism development would complement each other.
