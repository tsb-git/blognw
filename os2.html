                                   So far as India is concerned, Xi wants to checkmate its southern
giant neighbour from becoming a super power and also emerging
as its economic and military counterbalance not only in Asia but
the world over. This is why it is pursuing an encirclement plan in
India’s neighbourhood by building a string of naval ports, network
of strategic roads, railways and airports which will be used by its
military during peace and at times of war.
Xi’s expansionist plan is being openly aided and abetted by India’s
principal Opposition party, the Indian National Congress (INC), whose
top leaders signed a secret memorandum of understanding (MoU)
in Beijing with CCP in Xi’s presence in 2008 for closer co-operation
between the two parties. It also takes huge sums as donation for
activities of its various foundations. At the height of the Doklam
border standoff, its then Vice-President, Rahul Gandhi, secretly went
to the Chinese embassy in Delhi to meet the Chinese ambassador.
Despite public pressure, he never disclosed the subject or content
of his discussion. But one fallout of that meeting was that he and his
mother Sonia Gandhi, desperately tried to scuttle the Rafale fighter
deal that India had signed with France by alleging that Modi and his
business aides had got large kick backs from France. The Indian
Communists, who have always worked as China’s fifth column at
home, joined the Congress to undermine the deal and desperately
tried to scrap it so that this deadly combat aircraft did not join India’s
arsenal.

                                           Whenever Congress ruled India, right from the days of Jawaharlal
Nehru, China was allowed to annex huge chunks of Indian territory
without much difficulty. Nehru, in Indian parliament, justified the
annexation of 42,000 sq km of Aksai Chin in Ladakh because “not
a blade of grass grows there.” When the Chinese overran NEFA
and were at Tezpur’s doorstep, he, in a special radio broadcast bid
goodbye to the people of Brahmaputra Valley saying,”my heart goes
out to the people of Assam at this hour of their peril.”
China benefited not only territorially but also in every possible
way whenever Congress was in power. Nehru not only allowed the
Chinese annexation of Tibet but also recognized its sovereignty over
the region though, his then Home Minister , Vallabhbhai Patel, had
warned him that by allowing China to reach India’s doorstep “ India
in future would have serious security problems.” But Nehru rejected
Patel’s comment as “uninformed criticism, as China believed in
Lord Buddha’s Panchasheel doctrine of peaceful coexistence.” How
correct Patel was and Nehru was grievously wrong is borne out by
the happenings on the Sino- Indian border of last six decades. Nehru
was also in two minds to give asylum to Dalai Lama in 1959 as that
would irk the Chinese leadership. He, even after granting asylum
to His Holiness, was heard privately saying that he would welcome
Dalai Lama to leave India and seek asylum in any other country” as
China is angry with India for providing refuge to him and his huge
retinue” Nehru used to go out of his way to cultivate the Communist
Chinese even at the cost of his own and India’s national pride and
self-esteem. The Chinese found this as a great weakness in Nehru’s
character and exploited it to the hilt to its advantage.
During the three crucial years preceding the Chinese aggression
of 1962, Jawaharlal stationed his own first cousin R. K. Nehru as
India’s envoy to Beijing so that his orders for improving India’s relation
with China were carried out in letter and spirit. Jawaharlal’s objective
was to put Sino-India relations on a sound friendly footing. But R. K.
Nehru’s tenure as an envoy was a disaster as he was scorned and
pilloried by the Chinese Communist leadership for Nehru’s China
policy. Despite this, Jawaharlal steadfastly followed the one China
policy, though his party colleagues, like MahabirTyagi and others
and Opposition leaders like Ram Manohar Lohia and H.V. Kamath,
wanted India to recognize Taiwan also. But Nehru refused to exercise
this option on the ground that Mao-led Communist party government
represented the true and real Chinese people and Chiang Kai-shek’s
Kuomintang party led-Taiwan government was a lackey of American
imperialists and a renegade.
The Nehru Gandhi family has always been extremely deferential
to the Chinese communist leadership and their sensitivities and
has always sought to please and accommodate them in whatever
way possible, even at the cost of India’s international standing and
prestige, national security and territorial integrity. During 1962
Chinese aggression India’s state owned ALL India Radio used to
broadcast during the evening prime time a very popular programme
``India and the Dragon” anchored by India’s legendary and much
decorated broadcaster Melville De Mellow which dwelt exclusively
on Chinese betrayal of India. But China objected to this “highly
reprehensible broadcast as it fanned anti China sentiments among
Indians”. Immediately Nehru told then Information and Broadcasting
Minister to take the programme off the air. But when the then
Director General of AIR told his Minister and Jawaharlal Nehru that
China should do likewise by stopping anti-India broadcasts by Radio
Peking he was told to “mind his own business and not complicate
matters”.
In 1988, when Nehru’s grandson Rajiv Gandhi visited China as
India’s Prime Minister, he was told by the Chinese leadership that
India, in her own interest, should desist from building the border
infrastructure in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh. On his return
home, Rajiv not only ordered the stoppage of construction of border
infrastructure in the forward areas but enunciated the ridiculously
childish theory that India’s best defence against future Chinese
aggression lay in not building border infrastructure; he believed
that the absence of roads and communication facilities along the
LAC would make it difficult for the Chinese to come deep inside
the Indian territory. Worse, India’s Defence Ministers, including A K
Antony, even defended the rationale and soundness of this theory in
Parliament. This blunder committed by Rajiv Gandhi subsequently
emboldened the Chinese to issue the cheeky and atrocious diktat
to the Indian Government that Arunachal Pradesh, which it claimed
to be its territory, was a “no go area for Indian leaders, including its
President and Prime Minister”.
Beijing got angry when NarendraModi, unlike Nehru, Rajiv
Gandhi and Manmohan Singh, refused to be a supplicant Indian
Prime Minister and decided to challenge Chinese policies like the
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and refused to become a member of
China-led or sponsored exclusive economic regional groupings.
Unlike Nehru ,Rajiv and Manmohan, Modi refused to turn India into a
pliant state which made him incur Xi’s displeasure. What must have
irked Xi more was Modi’s decision to build border infrastructure,
especially in Ladakh, at breakneck speed which was very close to
his ambitious BRI projects in Chinese held Tibetan territory and in
PoK, through which its $64 billion-worth China Pakistan Economic
Corridor (CPEC) passes.
Beijing thinks that India, by building and strengthening her
infrastructure in Ladakh, is posing a serious security threat to its
geo-political ambitions in South Asia and the Indian Ocean regions.
The Chinese leadership has also grown extremely wary and jealous
of Narendra Modi’s growing international stature, popularity and
prestige. By opening four fronts in Ladakh, they want to punish and
humiliate Modi, at home and abroad, just as they did to Nehru in
1962, for not listening to all their dictats. Modi’s detractors at home
compare him to the Biblical figure David and Xi to Goliath. They say
that Modi, by taking on Xi is fighting an unequal battle. But they
forget that the puny David with his ordinary homemade sling shot
had shot down Goliath.
