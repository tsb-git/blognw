                                <h2>Controversy over H1B US visa –an analysis</h2>
                                <p class="excert">
                                    Currently the US H1B visa has become a subject of great
controversy in the Indian -US and in worldwide high tech sector. Let
me start from the beginning with the exact definition of the H1B visa.
This particular visa falls under the US Immigration and Nationality
Act, Section 101(a) (15) (H) that allows US companies to temporarily
employ foreign workers in specialty occupation.
The origination is found in overriding a veto by President Harry
S. Truman in 1952 when US Congress passed a law under Section
101-15H1. Since then it is known to be the H1. This visa allowed
someone from overseas who could temporarily provide services of
‘exceptional nature’ requiring such merit and ability. But the current
H1B visa came into being when President George W. Bush signed
the law in 1990. The law created H1A for nurses and H1B for very
specialty occupation. The H1A no longer exists. The H1B specialty
occupation visa requires at least a Bachelors degree in the specific
specialty or proof of his/her professional efficiency in particular field.
                                </p>
                                
                               
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-lg-12">
							<div class="col-lg-12 mt-25">
							
                                        <p>
                                           At present computer-related occupations constitute 69% of all
H1Bs. Architecture and Engineering are distant second. Three –
quarters of all H1B visa recipients are from India. This particular visa
has become so popular in recent years that 85,000 visas available
have usually been filled up in less than a week. At present the annual
statutory cap for H1B visas are 65,000 with additional 20,000 visas
for foreign professionals who graduated with a Master’s degree
or Doctoral degree from a US Institution of higher learning. So, the
total number of H1B visas have become 85,000 yearly. The H1B
visa allows foreign workers to stay in the US initially for 3 years
and later on the holders of that kind of visa can be approved for
yearly extension that allows them to live in US for up to six years.
Meanwhile, many of them can apply for Green Card and if approved
can live in US for indefinite period.
But the current administration of President Trump slowly has
started to curb the coming of all kinds of immigrants. Two years ago
President Trump signed the Executive Order “Buy Americans and
Hire Americans” and even before that he clearly declared his policy
“America First”. The interest of America will remain his first priority.
H1B visa has been a hot topic of discussion across many countries
for last two years since President Trump’s Executive Order.
                                        </p>
									
                                        <p>
                                            The leaders of high tech companies of US and many influential
politicians of America with higher or advanced degree in computer
and tech fields from India aspiring to work in US as well as the
leading IT Consulting Indian companies and even the Government
of India were apprehensive since last couple of months about the
rumor of tightening laws and regulations that might be enforced by
Trump administration to curb the incoming of foreign highly qualified
and skilled and all other kind of workers in American job market
which is currently in a bad shape due to COVID 19 , slipping global economic market into lockdowns.
The apprehensive rumor that was floating in air of Washington
D.C. and other high tech and business centers in US and around the
globe became a reality on Monday June 22 ,2020 when President
Trump signed the Executive Order suspending temporarily work
visas for H1B holders, This created a great uproar all around USA
and among Indians as they would be most hard sufferer of the
new situation. Various sources of foreign hiring companies and
recruiters have already been complaining about shortfalls in tech
talents in US, as a result of that new order. The Wall Street Journal
estimates that roughly 525,000 people including 170,000 Green
Card holders have been barred from entering the US since April. The
Trump administration official called the initiative, as quoted by the
Journal, an “American-first recovery” that would potentially open up
500,000 jobs for out of work Americans.<br>
The top ranking high tech computer companies like Microsoft,
Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon etc. openly protested against
the new Order as they fear to enter into deep trouble in the
highly competitive global market in case of innovation and new
programming without H1B visa holding talented and exceptionally
skilled professionals. In fact, a major portion of H1B visa holders are
essential components in the backbone of the advancement those
companies achieved during the last few decades. Anshu Sharma,
one CEO of a mid -ranking startup technology group Skyflow said
“Banning all H1B visas means CEOs like me have to open offices and
hire more people in countries like Canada that allows immigration.
This visa ban is morally wrong end economically stupid” This kind
of reaction from the head of tech company indicates that due to this
visa ban order more and more American company will be forced to
relocate their offices in other countries rather than changing their
policy to import more numbers of expert professionals from aboard
to face new challenges in the coming decades. That will surely
result into massive loss in American economy and failure to energize
domestic employment situation as the Trump administration hopes
to have. In fact, global technology leaders like Tim Cook of Apple
and Sundar Pichai of Google and many others came to America
for higher studies, settled down in US after getting good jobs and
by their own innovative excellence rose to the top position in their
companies. Critics of this visa ban Order pointed out that it ultimately
would deceive America from having exceptional talents. Mr. Pichai
wrote that Trump’s move would hurt innovation and delay recovery of
US economy. He felt disappointed by new proclamation and assured
that “We’ll continue to stand with immigrants and work to expand
opportunity for all.” Mr. Tim Cook of Apple wrote “ like Apple, this
nation of immigrants has always found strength in our diversity and
hope in the enduring promise of American Dream. There is no new
prosperity without both.”<br>
In fact, in 2019 seven of the top ten beneficiaries of the visa
grants were US companies such as Google, Apple, Face book that
had been hiring Indian engineers aggressively. On the other hand,
Indian IT service firms progressively reduced their dependency on
the H1B visa and began to explore other international markets.
It is not that the technology executives only coming out against
the tighter immigration rules. A large portion of powerful and
influential senators from the Republican party also came forward to
protest against this visa ban order of President Trump. On May 27,
nine Republican senators including South Carolina’s senior senator
Lindsey Graham and Texas senator John Cornyn signed a joint letter
and sent that to President Trump and pleaded against the rumor of
Visa ban. So, there is strong political pressure on President Trump
from his own Republican party especially in the face of coming
presidential election in November this year. The economically and
politically powerful India Lobby in US is all out to oppose new tighter
immigration rules. This NRI group of Indians gained immeasurable
power and influence on US mainstream politicians and their support
and cooperation for any party have been a deciding factor in the
general elections in US. Government of India not only expressed
displeasure against the new regulations on Immigration field, but
also started officially to negotiate with Trump administration for
the reconsideration of new laws, asking for an exception for Indian
immigrants. We know that the personal relationship between
President Trump and Primeminister Narendra Modi is in good humor.
Modi must exert his influence and friendliness on Trump to rethink
the new situation from the perspective of Indian immigrants .
It is a very crucial time in US politics. The charges of improper
handling of COVID 19 pandemic and the disastrous effects of it
on social and economic fields resulting in the loss of more than
125,000 lives and couple of hundreds of thousand people infected
by virus shook the US economy’s backbone to a great extent raising
unemployment to an unprecedented number. The combine effects of
these may be reflected in the coming presidential and congressional
elections. President Trump is not confident to win in his reelection
and the Democratic party as well as US Congress will try their best to
recapture White House. The situation is very fluid and anything may
happen at any time.
<br>At present, as the talented Indian computer experts need an
opportunity to go to America to prove their excellence, America also
needs to have talents of Indian computer engineers to maintain
their top global position in the field of technological innovation and
expertise. The game is now equally balanced in this sphere. India
and America need each other to flourish economically and politically.
The situation may take a dramatic turn at any moment.
